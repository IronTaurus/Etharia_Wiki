                    A long time ago the realms were much further apart from each other than what they are now, Athernis
                    and Devorna were closest to Mihridahl allowing the strongest gods and demons to be able to create a
                    pathway over to Mihridahl. A catastrophe however caused each realm to attract each other and
                    Athernis and Devorna crashed into Mihridahl. Both Devorna and Athernis became badly damaged and were
                    almost destroyed, now they are still damaged but at least stable.

                    Naerini that was far apart from Mihridahl was now instead very close allowing several creatures to
                    walk over through the broken barriers of Mihridah, Halflings and elves are some of these creatures.
                    This event also allowed a much easier way to travel between realms and it was no longer only
                    available to greater demons or gods.
                    With time the Ancient gods restored the barriers between the realms but even with the restored
                    barriers they were much weaker than before and creatures could sometimes slip through the remaining
                    cracks.
