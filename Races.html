                        are
                        in full control of their own thoughts. Among the Elestine there are two types, the Light

                        have almost
                        nonexistent pupils while still having an iris. The iris can be
                        different
                        colors from almost all spectrums but more commonly they are silver or blue. They often have long
                        sharp nails and large wings that enable them to fly. </p>

                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are a branch from the Fey Elves that built settlements near humans and
                        learned to coexist with them. Building cities they started to adapt to their surroundings and
                        became
                        what they are today.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Appearence:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are known for their sharp ears, much shorter than the others of their
                        kin
                        but still long compared to humans.
                        They often have golden blonde or silver white hair, there are cases where a high elf has other
                        colors but the most known high elf would have blonde hair and long hair that they are very proud
                        of.
                        The skin colors are often pale, and since they always take care of their beauty they often have
                        long
                        nails and a face untouched by battle.
                        High elf dress often in light clothes such as silk in bright colors, they love anything that
                        glimmers so crystals, gold and silver are often worn as jewelry. Heavy metals on the other hand,
                        such as iron gives the high elves a chilling sensation that makes them feel uneasy and weak.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Behaviour:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">Not at all as secluded as their relatives, high elves cherish their beauty and
                        are
                        not shy to show it for anyone who wishes to adore it. The high elves, unlike the others of their
                        kin, does not shy away from the other races; instead you can often find them mingling with other
                        races even though they often consider them a race of lesser status and beauty. They have a
                        strong
                        affection to beauty and light, often working in high positions and/or crafting of gold, jewelry
                        and
                        silk. Because of their long life span they are known for being expert craftsmen.

                    <p id="text-block">
                        A typical house of a High elf is that of a bright wooden house with plenty of carved or painted
                        decorations, the house would have many large windows to let as
                        much sunlight
                        in as
                        possible with silken drapes to cover them if needed. A typical high elf does not enjoy living in
                        cold environments and in harsh sleeping conditions.

                        Elves perceive time differently than other races, this is mainly due to their long life
                        span. Similar to how some people won’t notice or rather forget when they do some
                        everyday chores an elf will feel the same about the years that pass. This can result in
                        elves being very selective about what they remember and it is not uncommon for them to
                        not remember names of people they don’t find worthy of remembering. Through their
                        meditation they can handle their memories and can remember things they have forgotten
                        with this method.
