                        Eternal gods are something whose existence and power is undeniable, they donâ€™t require prayer to
                        enforce
                        their power or existence and very rarely answers any. An example of an eternal god is the Soln
                        and
                        Lunre,
                        which are the sun and moon in Mihridahl. The eternal gods maintain the reality and natural
                        order,
                        they
                        also
                        maintain the barrier that exists between the realms so that one realm would not affect the other
                        too
                        much.
                        Because of the way the eternal gods work it is often presumed that they are unaware of the
                        existence
                        of
                        other gods or creatures and simply do their work.

                        Immortal gods are no physical creatures, instead they are ideas and beliefs manifested in
                        Athernis
                        to
                        the point where it has taken the shape of a god.
                        While they are ideas and beliefs manifested they do have a will and that is mainly to spread the
                        idea
                        and belief that created them to the point where everyone is a copy of themself.
                        The power of an immortal god comes solely from their worshippers and cannot be killed by
                        physical
                        means.
                        Immortal gods can under normal circumstances not exist outside Athernis.

                        A mortal god is a mortal being that has reached godhood, this is when they are so powerful that
                        their
                        power rivals the gods and become worshiped.
                        While worshippers can grant them some power in reality most of a mortal god's power is coming
                        from
                        themselves. A mortal god still has a physical form and can be killed by physical means.
