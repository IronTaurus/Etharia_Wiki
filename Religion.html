        <p>
            Each creature is born as a part of the world tree, their body is connected to it and they are born and die
            as part of it. Apart from that there is also a certain connection to the Eternal Gods, the power from the
            sun and moon from light and darkness. Each creature is connected to them to some degree but players have a
            strong connection to the Eternal Gods and gain power from them.
            Now some may have another source as well such as an Immortal God or a pact with a Demon but regardless of
            that the connection with the Ancient Gods remains to be the majority of their power. Why these people have
            this power is not known but there is a name for them, the true children of the tree.

    <div class="main-block">
        <h1 class="block-title">Eternal Gods</h1>
        <p>
            Eternal gods are something whose existence and power is undeniable, they don’t require prayer to enforce
            their power or existence and very rarely answers any. An example of an eternal god is the Soln and Lunre,
            which are the sun and moon in Mihridahl. The eternal gods maintain the reality and natural order, they also
            maintain the barrier that exists between the realms so that one realm would not affect the other too much.
            Because of the way the eternal gods work it is often presumed that they are unaware of the existence of
            other gods or creatures and simply do their work.
        </p>

        <h1 id="Religion-Header">Immortal Gods</h1>
        <p id="Religion-text">
            Immortal gods gain power from their worshippers, while they have a lot of power they do not exist in any
            other realm than their own, instead they use peoples prayer to create a connection to other realms and
            enforce their existence there allowing them to use their powers to affect it. Even if they have no
            worshippers they still exist but only in their own realm unable to affect other realms.
            In Athernis, thought is such a strong nature force that it can manifest itself into reality, the Eternal
            gods don’t hold any actual physical body but rather is a strong thought and soul willed into reality, unlike
            demons this reality can only exist in that form on Athernis and would scatter the moment it set foot in most
            other realms apart from Devorna.
            The only place they would actually be able to continue to exist in is Devorna but only as a vessel to a
            demonic essence.
            An eternal god sees itself as the perfect being and wishes others to be as perfect as them, this leads the
            gods to try and influence other races to become more like them and ultimately make other races exactly like
            them in body and mind.

        </p>
        <h1 id="Religion-Header">Mortal Gods</h1>
        <p id="Religion-text">
            Mortal gods unlike Eternals can exist in any realm and while their powers may not be as great as the
            Eternals they are very powerful compared to any other living creature. A mortal god has a mortal body which
            means that they are killable.
            Unlike Eternal gods, mortal gods do not need to follow a certain portfolio but often they can gain a title
            based on their actions, such as if a mortal god shows its power in war it can be worshipped as a god of war.
